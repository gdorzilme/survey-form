# Sample Form (Mortgage Application intake form)

This project is a demonstration of the basic HTML and CSS skills I've learned as part of the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design certification.

The static HTML/CSS page mainly shows the applied skills of building an online form with an HTML5 validation applied to several fields. Placeholder texts are also displayed in several fields. The form also includes other types of fields in addition to text fields such as radio buttons, checkboxes, and a drop-down field. Finally, the form includes a textarea field where users can enter multiple lines of text as well as resize the text box to their liking. 

The CSS properties used on this landing page include the use of the Flexbox model
